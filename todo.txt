WHAT I NEED TO DO

write tests, will use ai to get this out the way quick
then refactor project


neeeed to reorg the project to lost the structure of uni project and gain strucutre of an actual node

need to seperate into modules

signer handles signatures key generation
this should only depend on the openssl crate node will use this to create wallets
signer should have opt to create a pkey, which can be a wrapper around evpkey with some methods to get the pub key, create from file etc

rpc will handle the rpc endpoints, this willl be able to run a server that can pass messages to the main node - will add this later

blockchain module
this will contain the core logic of  the application, later on this may be able to be split up into smaller modules, but will leave it like this for now

for now just need to implement the signer module and the blockchain module
